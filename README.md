# Mandelbrot

A low (but variable) resolution Mandelbrot plotter created in MATLAB.

Code is included to visualize the bifurcation diagram of the corresponding real-valued map.

The 'Mandelbrot' commit includes a .txt file representing the .m file for plotting the fractal.

The 'Bifurcate' commit include a .txt file representing the .m file representing the bifurcation diagram-plotting .m script.
